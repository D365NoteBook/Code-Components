**Features**

_Date Selection_
The control features a **DatePicker** component of @fluentui/react that allows users to easily select the date for their meeting. The DatePicker provides a visual calendar interface, 
enabling users to navigate through months and years and pick a date with a simple click.

_Time Selection_
In addition to date selection, the control also facilitates the selection of the **start time** and **end time**. This is achieved through two Dropdown components, each populated with 
time slots (slots are configurable, default is 30 min) in a 12-hour format (configurable, it can be 12-hour format also). Users can select the desired start and end times from these dropdowns, 
ensuring precise scheduling of their meetings.
